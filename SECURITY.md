## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security details to the maintainers (create a private issue or contact directly)
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed about our progress
- **Resolution**: We'll work to resolve the issue promptly
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if you want)

## Security Best Practices

When using this scraper, please follow these security best practices:

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update Python packages and Playwright
2. **Use Virtual Environments**: Isolate the scraper in a virtual environment
3. **Secure Chrome Profile**: Don't use your main Chrome profile for scraping
4. **Monitor Network Activity**: Be aware of the network requests being made
5. **Respect Rate Limits**: Don't make excessive requests that could be flagged

### For Developers

1. **Code Reviews**: All code changes should be reviewed
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
4. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
5. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys or sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Browser Automation Risks

- **Profile Isolation**: The scraper creates temporary Chrome profiles to isolate sessions
- **Data Exposure**: Be cautious about what data you scrape and how you store it
- **Network Monitoring**: Scraping activities may be logged by network administrators

### Dependencies

- **Playwright**: Keep Playwright updated for the latest security patches
- **PyQt5**: Ensure GUI framework is up to date
- **Python**: Use a supported Python version with security updates

### Data Privacy

- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- **Data Minimization**: Only scrape data that you actually need
- **Secure Storage**: Store scraped data securely
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

1. **Temporary Profiles**: Creates isolated Chrome profiles for each session
2. **User Agent Rotation**: Uses realistic user agents
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implements delays to avoid detection
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling prevents information leakage

### Recommended Additional Security

1. **VPN Usage**: Consider using a VPN for additional privacy
2. **Proxy Rotation**: Implement proxy rotation for large-scale scraping
3. **Request Headers**: Customize headers to appear more legitimate
4. **Session Management**: Properly manage and cleanup browser sessions

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3-7**: Investigation and assessment
4. **Day 8-30**: Development of fix
5. **Day 31**: Security update released
6. **Day 32+**: Public disclosure (if appropriate)
